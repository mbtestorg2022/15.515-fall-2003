Objectives
----------

This section of the session road map below specifies the learning objectives you should achieve through (a) the assigned readings and homework, (b) the class discussion or lecture, or (c) the weekly T.A. session (if needed). Periodically, it also summarizes key concepts. You and your group can gauge your progress by assessing the extent to which you have met these objectives and understand the concepts.\<

Class Preparation Questions
---------------------------

As these problems are related to the class discussion and often will be used as the basis of class discussion, they should receive your utmost attention. You may find it valuable to discuss these with your group members before class. Some questions refer to the Intel 2002 Annual Report, which is available for download from the Intel Web site. ([PDF](https://www.intel.cn/content/dam/doc/report/history-2002-annual-report.pdf))#

**Principles of Accrual Accounting ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/lec2))  
  
**Objectives:

1\. Understand how accrual accounting differs from a cash basis.  
  
2\. Develop a mental model for classifying types of accounting accruals.  
  
3\. Understand how accruals affect the financial statement.  
  
4\. Become familiar with the basic bookkeeping model that illustrates how record keeping impacts the financials.  
  
5\. Understand the accounting cycle:  
a. recording events during the accounting period,  
b. end-of-period adjustments,

d. financial statement preparation.


{{< tdclose >}}

Class Preparation Questions:  
  
1\. How do the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet relate to one another?  
  
2\. What does a firm's ending balance of Retained Earnings represent? In Figure 4-11 on p. 167 of Pratt, Why does Net Income appear on both the Income Statement AND the Statement of Retained Earnings? Why does Ending Retained Earnings Balance not equal Ending Cash Balance on the Balance Sheet?

3\. How do you determine what fiscal period a firm is using? Why would companies use something other than calendar year as a fiscal period?  
  
4\. From a financial reporting perspective, what's the difference between consistency and uniformity? Why do U.S. accounting principles require the former but not the latter?  
  
5\. What is the difference between capitalizing and expensing a cost?  
  
6\. How is recognizing depreciation for PP&E an example of the Matching Principle?  
  
7\. Pratt E4-19 (we will do this in class).

**Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/lec4))

4\. Work on a detailed example: reverse engineering Intel's cash collections in 2001.
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Class Preparation Questions:  
  
1\. What are the criteria necessary to recognize revenue?  
  
2\. Under what circumstances would managers have the incentive to manipulate the timing of revenue recognition? How would they do it? What risks are involved?  
  
3\. Instead of using an ADA (Allowance for Doubtful Accounts) account, why can't we just subtract estimated future write-offs from the Accounts Receivable?  
  
4\. Problem E6-7 from the course textbook: J. Pratt. _Financial Accounting in an Economic Context._ 5th ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.  
  
5\. What is Intel's revenue recognition policy?

Class Preparation Questions:  
  
In addition to the two questions at the back of Circuit City (CC), answer the following:  
  
1\. Show the BSE (Balance Sheet Equation) effects of the following events under the 3 accounting alternatives described on pp. 2 and 3.  
  
a. On 1/1/90, CC sells a stereo for $1,000 cash. Cost of inventory is $900. Customer also pays $100 cash for 2-year warranty coverage, which CC expects to require $20 in parts and labor over that period (through 12/31/91).  
  
b. 12/90, the customer brings the stereo in for inspection. Actual cost to CC is $8.  
  
c. 12/91, the customer brings the stereo in again; actual cost to CC is $15.  
  
2\. Compare yearly and total Net Income (i.e., for 1990 + 1991) of the scenario posed above under the three accounting treatments.  
  
3\. How will Circuit City's financial statements be affected if the FASB requires them to change the accounting treatment for extended warranty and product maintenance contracts? What additional information or assumptions would you need to estimate the dollar impact of this change?  
  
4\. As a user (lender, investor) of CC's financial statements, how would you prefer they account for extended warranty contracts? Why?

**Marketable Securities and Valuation Adjustments ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/lec11))  
  
**Objectives:  
  
1\. Understand when accounting departs from the "transactions-based" model and towards market-driven valuations.  
  
2\. Illustrate the role of judgment in applying the LCM rule for inventory.  
  
3\. Understand how marketable securities are valued on companies' Balance Sheets.  
  
4\. Understand the Income Statement effects of valuation adjustments.
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Class Preparation Questions:  
  
1\. When should market values be used in the valuation of assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet?  
  
2\. Are there cash flow effects of the "mark-to-market" rule?  
  
3\. The former GAAP requires lower-of-cost-or-market in the accounting for marketable securities, applied on a portfolio basis. If managers have the incentive to increase earnings, what behavior is induced by this rule? How does "mark-to-market" mitigate this behavior?  
  
4\. The new GAAP gives discretion to managers on how marketable securities are classified, based on managers' intent. Although most securities are marked-to-market, this new GAAP still allows securities (in particular, debt securities) to be carried at historical cost. Given this discretion in classification, does the new rule improve the ability of accounting to measure firm performance?  
  
5\. What was the market value of the Available for Sale securities held by Intel at the end of 2002? What was the original cost to Intel? What was the tax effect of the appreciation/depreciation?
